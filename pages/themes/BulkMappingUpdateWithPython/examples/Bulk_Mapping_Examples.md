## Scenario 1: Standardizing Campaign Names Across Platforms

Campaign names might be formatted differently in various marketing platforms (e.g., Google Ads vs. Facebook Ads).

Develop a Python script that reads campaign data from different platforms (using their APIs).

Implement a dictionary mapping to translate platform-specific abbreviations or naming conventions to a standard formats.

Use Pandas functions like rename or replace to apply the mapping to the campaign names within the dataframes.

The script can then output the transformed data to a format suitable for AnaliticalSystem import.


## Scenario 2: Converting Date Formats for Cross-Platform Analysis

Challenge: Dates might be stored in different formats across data sources (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY vs. YYYY-MM-DD). This hinders accurate analysis of campaign performance across platforms.
Solution with Python:
Design a Python script that retrieves marketing data from various sources.
Utilize Pandas functions like to_datetime to convert source data into a consistent date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) suitable for AnaliticalSystem.
The script can handle potential errors like invalid date formats using try-except blocks.

## Scenario 3: Mapping Custom KPIs to AnaliticalSystem Fields

Challenge: Your company might track specific KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that aren't directly available in marketing platforms. These KPIs need to be calculated and integrated into AnaliticalSystem for analysis.
Solution with Python:
Create a Python script that retrieves relevant data points from marketing platforms.
Implement custom logic using Python functions or libraries (like NumPy) to calculate the desired KPIs based on the retrieved data.
Use Pandas to create new columns in the dataframe to store the calculated KPIs.
Define a mapping dictionary to match these custom KPI column names to appropriate fields within AnaliticalSystem.

## Bonus Scenario: Handling Missing or Inconsistent Data

Challenge: Data from different sources might have missing values or inconsistencies that can affect analysis.
Solution with Python:
Enhance your scripts to identify missing values using Pandas functions like isna.
Implement strategies to handle missing data (e.g., impute average values, remove rows with too many missing entries).
Develop logic to identify and potentially correct data inconsistencies (e.g., typos in product names).
