""" DESCRIPTION:
Given is a list celsius_temps = [0, 30, 100] with Celsius temperatures.
Write a function, which will convert all temperatures in the list from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The formula for conversion is: Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32
This task should help you practice with map for transformation purposes.

""" DESCRIPTION:
Given is a list with users data. Write a function which will return a list of all user names, for those users who have positive balance.
This task should help you practice with map and filter function for transformation/filtering purposes.

""" DESCRIPTION:
Given is a list of Douglas Adams quotes. Write a function which will output in the console only the words that starts with letter 't' and are longer than 3 symbols. For simplicity, assume that words a space separated tokens.

# [['travels', 'than'], ['that', 'trying']]



# ---------------------------------- Task 4 ---------------------------------- #
""" DESCRIPTION:
Given the list of Douglas Adams quotes, write a function that finds the total number of words across all quotes. For simplicity, assume that words are space-separated tokens. Use the reduce function to accumulate the total count.
This task should help you practice using map and reduce for aggregation purposes.
