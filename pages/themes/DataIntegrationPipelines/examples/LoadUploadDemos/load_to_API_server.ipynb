    "# Load Integrated Data to API Server\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this phase is to demonstrate the process of integrating and synchronizing our locally processed data with a remote API server. By using GitHub as our target, we aim to simulate a real-world application of pushing updates or new entries to an external system, which could represent updating CRM records, synchronizing marketing data across platforms, or even managing inventory data in e-commerce scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps for Loading Data to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare the Data**: Ensure that the integrated data is in a format that can be accepted by the GitHub API. For our purposes, this could involve converting DataFrame to a JSON payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Authentication**: To interact with the GitHub API, we must authenticate using a personal access token (PAT). This token ensures that our script has permission to make changes to the specified repository.\n",
    "   For demonstration purposes we will use next PAT: \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   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\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   which gives us read/write access to content of github user: ProgressBG-Python-Course, repo name: Shared\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **API Interaction**: Use the `requests` library in Python to make HTTP requests to the GitHub API. This involves specifying the appropriate endpoint, headers (including the authorization token), and the data payload in our request.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pushing Updates**: Craft the requests to either create new files in the repository or update existing ones with the latest data from our pipeline. GitHub's API allows for actions such as committing new files, updating content, and even managing pull requests.\n",
